<p>Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies. State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools offering elementary education (Grades 1–8) were managed by government and 16.86% of schools were under private management (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme and in alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one third are 'aided' and two thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is shared between government and privately managed schools in the ratio 73:27. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower (36:66).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_India#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for males and 65% for females.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Statistical_Commission">National Statistical Commission</a>&nbsp;surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18, 84.7% for male and 70.3% for female.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_India#cite_note-FOOTNOTENSO201843-8">[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%.

<p>Poorly resourced public schools which suffer from high rates of teacher absenteeism may have encouraged the rapid growth of private (unaided) schooling in India, particularly in urban areas. Private schools divide into two types: recognized and unrecognized schools. Government 'recognition' is an official stamp of approval and for this, a private school is required to fulfill a number of conditions, though hardly any private schools that get 'recognition' actually fulfill all the conditions of recognition. Indian schools are no less than factories. The emergence of large numbers of unrecognized primary schools suggests that schools and parents do not take government recognition as a stamp of quality.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_India#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural children between the ages of 6–14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to report enrolment above 96%. India has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this age group from year 2007 to 2014. As an outcome the number of students in the age group 6–14 who are not enrolled in school has come down to 2.8% in the academic year 2018 (ASER 2018).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_India#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>&nbsp;Another report from 2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India, from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 2.3&nbsp;million students over 2002 total enrolment, and a 19% increase in girl's enrolment.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_India#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>&nbsp;While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system. While more than 95 per cent of children attend primary school, just 40 per cent of Indian adolescents attend secondary school (Grades 9–12). Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2&nbsp;billion to education in India. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of teachers every day.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_India#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>&nbsp;States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to identify and improve such schools.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_India#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Measurement_Initiative">Human Rights Measurement Initiative</a>&nbsp;finds that India is achieving only 79.0% of what should be possible at its level of income for the right to education.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_India#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p>Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited educational institution) and all the other aspects of the operation. Hence, the differentiation between government schools and private schools can be misleading.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_India#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>&nbsp;However, in a report by Geeta Gandhi Kingdon entitled:&nbsp;<em>The Emptying of Public Schools and Growth of Private Schools in India</em>, it is said that for sensible education-policy making, it is vital to take account of the various changing trends in the size of the private and public schooling sectors in India. Ignoring these trends involves the risk of poor policies/legislation, with adverse effects on children's education.</p>
